## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.* 
I have used the adjustText library to display the scatterplots without overlapping labels, however this is optional.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Kaggle data from 2016 to better understand:

1. Which European countries have the best weather?
2. Are the weather and the wealth of European countries negative correlated?
3. How is life expectancy in Europe?
4. Which factors correlate to life expectancy?
5. Which are the best European countries to live in, considering weather, median income and life expectancy?



## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@soniafogari/the-best-european-countries-to-live-in-a404d0fd6b8f).
